# Personal Project - Avalanche Blockchain based Arbitrage Bot

## Overview

- *Project Type:* Personal Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Bot
- *Technologies:* Python, Web3.py, Blockchain APIs, DeFi Protocols

Designed and implemented a cryptocurrency arbitrage bot that monitors decentralized liquidity pools for price discrepancies across DeFi platforms. The bot identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities in real time and executes trades programmatically.

*NOTE: While currently inactive, I plan to revisit and enhance its efficiency and execution logic using new knowledge i have gained at some point in the future.*
*I also intend to improve notes on the code for better readability*

## Key Features & Implementation Highlights:

- Took a self-directed, trial-and-error approach due to limited technical documentation, deepening my understanding of smart contract interactions, token pricing, and asynchronous programming.
- Focused on low-latency logic, real-time data fetching, and safe execution practices to avoid slippage and failed transactions.
- Gained hands-on experience with blockchain fundamentals, token pair pricing mechanisms, and DeFi market behaviors.  
- Project is currently inactive but serves as a strong foundation for future optimization and expanded functionality.
